<p>Living in rural areas without adequate electricity supplies &mdash;
&ldquo;off grid&rdquo; or with unreliable supplies and frequent power
outages, can have a big impact on everyday life as well as on
education and the development of business opportunities
such as home-working and trading.
Households use expensive and potentially dangerous lighting
such as candles and oil.
After natural disasters or other events, power supplies and
lighting may become unreliable or non-existent.</p>

<h2>Beacons of Hope</h2>

<p>Solar rechargeable lamps provide a clean, effective way to
overcome these problems. The units can be switched on
and off manually, but also have an automatic switch
position: they turn on by themselves, when the regular
power supply shuts off and mains-powered lighting fails.
Positioning the unit in any reasonable lighting level (even
under artificial light) causes the charger to re-start
automatically and top up the internal batteries. The
efficient LED light will operate for several hours
continuously after a few hours of normal charging levels.</p>

<p>The internal batteries can be regular rechargeable units
such as AA cells (which can be swapped in and out) and
the battery compartment is also adapted to take several
different types of standard mobile phone battery &mdash; so
users can also keep operating with that vital tool of life
today, connecting with family, friends and business
contacts and markets. A USB socket also provides for
direct power off-take for phone charging or other small
devices.</p>

<h3>Base Model</h3>

<p>The original Beacon of Hope lamp with a simple
metal table stand; also designed to balance so that
the stand can be used as a loop to suspend the
lamp from any suitable hook, rail or cord.</p>

<h3>Folding model</h3>

<p>The new folding design stands on a desk or
table, but folds into a neat, compact unit
for portability: perfect for the school-bag or
briefcase, it can also be used as a portable
flashlight!</p>
